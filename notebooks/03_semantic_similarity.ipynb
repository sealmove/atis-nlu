    "Natural language allows us to express the same concept in different ways and with different words. Every language has synonyms and semantically related words. There are usually two ways to recognize semantic similarity, either with a synonyms dictionary or with word vector-based semantic similarity methods. We will discuss both approaches."

    "\n",
    "We already saw that in most cases, the transitive verbs and direct objects express the intent. An easy way to determine whether two utterances represent the same intent is to check whether the verbs and the direct objects are synonyms.\n",
